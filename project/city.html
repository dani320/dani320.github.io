        <h2>
            Bogota Demographic
        </h2>

        <p>
            The majority of the population of Bogota is European or of European-mixed descent. The people of mixed
            descent are those of Mestizo origin. This means they are of European, mostly Spanish, and indigenous
            descent. There is a small minority of Afro-Colombian and Indigenous people as well.

            Historically, Bogota’s main religion was Roman Catholic, and the city is the seat of the Roman Catholic
            Archdiocese of Bogota. Currently, a large portion of the population has declared they are non-practicing.
        </p>
        <h2>Bogota Population</h2>
        <p>Bogota was originally a settlement of indigenous people. The original indigenous people migrated to the area
            from Mesoamerica. The Spanish colonized it in 1553, and the population multiplied to 18,161 inhabitants in
            the 1789 census. The population of Bogota has proliferated since the 1800s.

            Since 1800, the city has grown from around twenty-two thousand people to eight million. Part of this growth
            in population was due to the Catholic Church creating the diocese in Bogota. Another big factor in the
            growth of the city was immigration from the eastern highlands. Many displaced people have settled in Bogota.
            Growth was very high between 1800 and 2000 -maintaining growth rates of at least 9% with peak rates reaching
            nearly 200% over the years. After two hundred years - it started to slow. The city is still growing, though
            at a rate of between 2 and 9% per year.</p>
